                <h2>Why You Need a Strong Password</h2>
                <p>
                    In today's digital world, your password is the first line of defense against hackers and identity theft. Using weak passwords like "123456" or "password" is like leaving your front door unlocked. A <strong>Strong Password Generator</strong> creates complex, random combinations of characters that are nearly impossible for computers to guess or crack.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Security experts recommend using a unique password for every single account. Our tool makes it easy to generate as many unique passwords as you need, instantly.
                </p>

                <h2>What Makes a Password Strong?</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Length:</strong> This is the most critical factor. A 12-character password is exponentially harder to crack than an 8-character one. We recommend at least 12-16 characters.</li>
                    <li><strong>Complexity:</strong> Mixing uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols increases the "entropy" (randomness) of your password.</li>
                    <li><strong>Unpredictability:</strong> Avoid common words, phrases, or personal dates (like birthdays). Random strings are best.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>How to Use This Tool</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Set Length:</strong> Use the slider to choose your desired password length (default is 12).</li>
                    <li><strong>Select Options:</strong> Check the boxes to include Uppercase, Lowercase, Numbers, and Symbols.</li>
                    <li><strong>Generate:</strong> Click the button to create a new random password.</li>
                    <li><strong>Copy:</strong> Click the copy icon to save it to your clipboard.</li>
                </ol>

                    question: "Q. Is it safe to generate passwords online?",
                    answer: "A. Yes, absolutely. This tool runs entirely in your browser (client-side). The passwords are generated locally on your device and are never sent to our servers. We cannot see or store them."

                    question: "Q. How can I remember these complex passwords?",
                    answer: "A. You shouldn't try to memorize them! We highly recommend using a Password Manager (like Bitwarden, 1Password, or LastPass) to store your unique passwords securely."

                {
                    question: "Q. Why are symbols important?",
                    answer: "A. Adding symbols expands the set of possible characters, making \"brute force\" attacks (where hackers try every combination) take significantly longer."
