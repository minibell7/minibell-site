                <h2>Why Use a Tip Calculator?</h2>
                <p>
                    Dining out with friends or grabbing a taxi should be a pleasant experience, but figuring out the tip at the end can sometimes be awkward or confusing. Mental math isn't for everyone, especially after a big meal! A <strong>Tip Calculator</strong> ensures you leave the right amount of gratuity without the headache.

                <p>
                    Our tool not only calculates the tip based on your desired percentage but also helps you <strong>split the bill</strong> evenly among your group. No more arguing over who owes what.
                </p>

                        <h3>Q. Is the tip calculated on the tax?</h3>
                        <p>A. Technically, etiquette suggests calculating the tip on the <em>pre-tax</em> subtotal. However, many people simply tip on the final total for convenience. Our calculator works with whatever number you enter.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div className={styles.faqItem}>
                        <h3>Q. What if the service was bad?</h3>
                        <p>A. In the US, tipping is a significant part of a server's income. If service was poor, 10-15% is often still left, perhaps with a polite word to the manager. Leaving $0 is considered very rude unless the experience was egregious.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div className={styles.faqItem}>
                        <h3>Q. How do I split the bill?</h3>
                        <p>A. Simply use the "+" button in the "Number of People" section. The "Cost Per Person" line will show you exactly what each share is.</p>
