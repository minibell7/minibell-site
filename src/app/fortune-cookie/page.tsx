                <h2>A Brief History</h2>
                <p>
                    While often associated with Chinese restaurants in the West, the fortune cookie's origins are actually debated. Many researchers trace them back to 19th-century Japan, where a similar cracker called "tsujiura senbei" was sold at temples with fortunes tucked inside. They were popularized in the United States by Japanese and Chinese immigrants in California in the early 20th century and have since become a global phenomenon.
