                <h2>Why Use a D-Day Calculator?</h2>
                <p>
                    Life is full of special moments worth counting down to or remembering. Whether it's the excitement of an upcoming vacation, the nervousness of a big exam, or the joy of a romantic anniversary, keeping track of time adds meaning to these events. A <strong>D-Day Calculator</strong> simplifies this by doing the math for you.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Instead of manually counting days on a calendar, our tool instantly tells you exactly how many days are left until a future date (D-) or how many days have passed since a past date (D+). It's perfect for couples tracking their relationship milestones, students counting down to the SATs, or anyone waiting for a special occasion.
                </p>

                <h2>Key Features</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Versatile Counting:</strong> Supports both countdowns (future dates) and anniversaries (past dates).</li>
                    <li><strong>"Day 1" Option:</strong> Includes a toggle to include the start date as Day 1, a common practice in East Asian cultures for relationship anniversaries.</li>
                    <li><strong>Automatic Milestones:</strong> For past events, it automatically calculates significant future milestones like the 100th, 200th, 365th (1 year), and 1000th day.</li>
                    <li><strong>Simple & Clean Interface:</strong> No clutter, just the dates and numbers you need.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>How to Calculate Anniversaries Correctly</h2>
                <p>
                    Calculating anniversaries can be tricky depending on cultural context. In many Western cultures, an anniversary is celebrated exactly one year after the event (e.g., married on Jan 1st, 1st anniversary is next Jan 1st). However, for counting "days together," some cultures count the first day as Day 1.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Example:</strong> If you started dating on January 1st:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Standard Calculation:</strong> January 2nd is "1 day" since.</li>
                    <li><strong>Inclusive Calculation (Day 1):</strong> January 1st is Day 1, so January 2nd is Day 2.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Our tool lets you choose the method that fits your needs with a simple checkbox.</p>
