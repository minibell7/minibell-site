                <h2>How to Play US Powerball</h2>
                <p>
                    The US Powerball is one of the most popular and potentially lucrative lottery games in the world. With jackpots often reaching hundreds of millions (and sometimes billions) of dollars, it captures the imagination of millions. To play, you must select <strong>5 white balls</strong> (numbers from 1 to 69) and <strong>1 red Powerball</strong> (number from 1 to 26).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Many players struggle to pick numbers, often relying on birthdays or anniversaries which limits their range to 1-31. Our <strong>Powerball Number Generator</strong> solves this by providing truly random selections across the entire number range, maximizing your statistical coverage.
                </p>

                <h2>Why Use a Random Number Generator?</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Avoid Bias:</strong> Humans are terrible at being random. We tend to pick patterns or meaningful dates. A generator ensures a purely mathematical selection.</li>
                    <li><strong>Full Range Coverage:</strong> By using a generator, you are just as likely to get a 69 as a 7, ensuring you don't miss out on high numbers.</li>
                    <li><strong>Quick & Easy:</strong> Generate multiple sets of numbers in seconds without overthinking.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Winning Combinations</h2>
                <p>There are 9 ways to win a prize in Powerball:</p>
