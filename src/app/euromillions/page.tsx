                <h2>What is EuroMillions?</h2>
                <p>
                    EuroMillions is Europe's favorite transnational lottery, played across nine countries including the UK, France, Spain, and Switzerland. With draws taking place every Tuesday and Friday, it offers huge tax-free jackpots (in most countries) that can change lives overnight. To play, you select <strong>5 main numbers</strong> (1-50) and <strong>2 Lucky Stars</strong> (1-12).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Struggling to pick your numbers? Our <strong>EuroMillions Number Generator</strong> acts as your personal "Lucky Dip," providing you with a completely random set of numbers to play for the next draw.
                </p>

                <h2>Why Use a Number Generator?</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Speed:</strong> Generate multiple lines in seconds without thinking.</li>
                    <li><strong>Randomness:</strong> Avoid the common pitfall of picking patterns or dates, which many other players also do. If you win with a unique random set, you are less likely to share the jackpot!</li>
                    <li><strong>Convenience:</strong> Use it on the go, right before you buy your ticket.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Winning Combinations</h2>
                <p>There are 13 prize tiers in EuroMillions, giving you plenty of chances to win:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Jackpot:</strong> 5 Main Numbers + 2 Lucky Stars</li>
                    <li><strong>Tier 2:</strong> 5 Main Numbers + 1 Lucky Star</li>
                    <li><strong>Tier 3:</strong> 5 Main Numbers</li>
                    <li><strong>Tier 4:</strong> 4 Main Numbers + 2 Lucky Stars</li>
                    <li><strong>...and more:</strong> You can win a prize just for matching 2 main numbers!</li>
                </ul>
