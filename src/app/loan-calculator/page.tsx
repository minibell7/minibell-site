                <h2>Why Use a Loan Calculator?</h2>
                <p>
                    Borrowing money is a significant financial commitment. Whether you're buying a new car, purchasing a home, or taking out a personal loan, understanding the true cost of the loan is crucial. A <strong>Loan Calculator</strong> helps you see beyond the "sticker price" and understand how interest rates and loan terms affect your monthly budget.
                </p>
                <p>
                    By adjusting the loan amount, interest rate, and term length, you can find a payment plan that fits your financial situation comfortably.
                </p>

                <h2>How to Use</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Loan Amount:</strong> Enter the total amount you plan to borrow (principal).</li>
                    <li><strong>Interest Rate:</strong> Enter the annual interest rate (APR) offered by the lender.</li>
                    <li><strong>Loan Term:</strong> Enter the number of years you have to pay back the loan.</li>
                    <li><strong>Analyze:</strong> Instantly see your estimated Monthly Payment, Total Interest paid over the life of the loan, and the Total Cost.</li>
                </ol>

                <h2>Understanding the Results</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Monthly Payment:</strong> This is the amount you must pay every month to pay off the loan by the end of the term.</li>
                    <li><strong>Total Interest:</strong> This is the "cost" of borrowing. It's money paid to the lender on top of the original loan amount.</li>
                    <li><strong>Total Cost:</strong> Principal + Interest. This is the actual amount of money leaving your pocket.</li>
                </ul>

                    question: "Q. Does this calculator work for mortgages?",
                    answer: "A. Yes, it uses the standard amortization formula used for fixed-rate mortgages, auto loans, and personal loans. However, it does not include extra costs like property taxes, insurance, or HOA fees often associated with mortgages."

                    question: "Q. How can I lower my monthly payment?",
                    answer: "A. You can lower your payment by: 1) Borrowing less, 2) Securing a lower interest rate (improve your credit score), or 3) Extending the loan term (though this increases total interest paid)."

                    question: "Q. What is APR?",
