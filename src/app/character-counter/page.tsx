                        <h3>Q. Why is word count important?</h3>
                        <p>A. Word count is often used as a metric for depth and readability. Blog posts often aim for 1,500+ words for SEO, while news articles might be shorter. Knowing your word count helps you hit the right target for your audience.</p>
